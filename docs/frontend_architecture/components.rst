Vue components
==============

We leverage `Vue.js components <https://vuejs.org/guide/components.html>`__ as the primary building blocks for our UI. For general UI development work, this is the most common tool a developer will use. It would be prudent to read through the `Vue.js guide <https://vuejs.org/guide/>`__ thoroughly.

Each component contains HTML with dynamic Vue.js directives, styling which is scoped to that component (written using `SCSS <https://sass-lang.com/>`__), and logic which is also scoped to that component (all code, including that in Vue components should be written using `Bubl√© compatible ES2015 JavaScript <https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features>`__).

Components allow us to define new custom tags that encapsulate a piece of self-contained, re-usable UI functionality. When composed together, they form a tree structure of parents and children. Each component has a well-defined interface used by its parent component, made up of `input properties <https://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Props>`__, `events <https://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Custom-Events>`__ and `content slots <https://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Content-Distribution-with-Slots>`__. Components should never reference their parent.

Read through the :doc:`./conventions` for further guidelines on writing components.


Design system
-------------

Our `design system <http://kolibribeta.learningequality.org/design>`__ contains reusable patterns and components that should be used whenever possible to maintain UI consistency and avoid duplication of effort.


SVG Icons
---------

Icons in Kolibri should be accessed through the ``<KIcon>`` component. The icons available can be found and searched at `Kolibri Design System <https://kolibri-design-system.netlify.app/icons/>`__.

Each icon is associated with a token, which is passed to ``<KIcon>`` and other Kolibri Design System components which accept an ``icon`` or ``iconAfter`` prop such as ``KIconButton``.
